Hi there! We're working on getting things in order to get some great info up here soon.

We believe that it is past time for all-electric power farm and garden tractors to replace Diesel and gasoline powered tractors in yards and commercial farms where electrical power is abundant and reliable. Electric motors have better torque, better reliability, and lower maintenance needs than their petrol counterparts. Improved battery technologies now make it possible to store the electrical energy for a full day of hard work, negating the historic advantage of chemical fuels.

Stay tuned for more detailed break-downs of the advantages of electric over diesel and gas in the yard and on the farm and for how new technologies are shaping the future of the tractor industry.
